On checking we found that they primarily belong to vh32 and vh25. We are unable to ping or Rdp the server. We are unable to take console for them We can't find anything critical in the logs. Later L2 team and virtualization team checked from their end and found that Mentioned sch3-ta03-vh32 host was isolated from the network, However Virtualization team rebooted the host & all VMs are migrated to a different host in the same cluster post which we were able to access all the VMs and servers. And KGS -ART validated the servers from their end. 05/18/2018 03:20:13 - Simiran Kaur (Work notes) Work Notes: 05/18/2018 00:10:39 - Kch-manage-ch01 (Additional comments) received from: kch-manage-ch01@kronos.net ************************************************* This Alarm is generated from Applications Manager running at https://sch3-sa01-am07.hosting.local:8443 Details of entities that invoked the action Monitor of interest : d-marrit-d-a02 Attribute of interest : Availability Message : Resource down Root Cause : The resource d-marrit-d-a02 is not available.
